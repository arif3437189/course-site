= EE192: Mechatronics Design Lab

== Checkpoint 2
This weekâ€™s lab checkpoint is simple, so you can devote more effort to the project proposal.

=== If you have a used car
Strip the car down to its chassis
- Save any useful components (including but not limited to: heatsinks, ICs, switches, wood, and plastic)
- Remove and return all electronic assmeblies (circuit boards, sensors, and the like). These will be kept in the lab as a reference for all teams.

=== If you have a new car
Build the car chassis
- Ensure no parts are missing
- [files/TheFreescaleCupCarModelAssemblyManual.pdf Instructions (PDF)]
